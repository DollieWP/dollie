# Dollie Setup

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cuny-academic-commons/dollie-setup.svg?branch=1.1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/cuny-academic-commons/dollie-setup)

## About The Project

[Dollie Setup](https://commonsinabox.org/) (DOLLIE_SETUP) takes the complexity out of creating an online space, or digital commons, for community and collaboration. Built using the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) publishing platform, with [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org) for social networking, DOLLIE_SETUP comes in two customizable packages:

**DOLLIE_SETUP Classic is designed for communities of all kinds.** It is used by groups and organizations to create flexible social networks where members can collaborate on projects, publish research, and create repositories of knowledge.

**DOLLIE_SETUP OpenLab is specifically designed for teaching, learning, and collaboration.** It allows faculty members, departments, and entire institutions to create commons spaces for open learning.

Dollie Setup is developed by a team based at [The Graduate Center, CUNY](https://www.gc.cuny.edu). It was originally made possible by a grant from the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org). DOLLIE_SETUP OpenLab, a collaboration with [New York City College of Technology](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu), was created with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanitiesâ€™ [Office of Digital Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh). DOLLIE_SETUP receives continuing support from the City University of New York and The Graduate Center, CUNY.
