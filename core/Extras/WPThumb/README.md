WP Thumb is a simple but powerful plugin that seamlessly intergrates with the Core WordPress image handling. You specify height, width and crop values and an image will be generated and cached for future use.

* Automatic dynamic images resizing, cropping and caching.
* Ideal for when you want to change the dimensions of default image sizes.
* Can extend using filters to make use of any of the phpThumb Library functions by manipulating the image object.
* Integrate with Imgix & S3 via the [WP Thumb Bridge](https://github.com/humanmade/wpthumb-bridge)
