### Privacy Policy
Dollie uses Appsero SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.
Appsero SDK does not gather any data by default. The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data **when a user allows it via the admin notice**. We collect the data to ensure a great user experience for all our users.
Integrating Appsero SDK does not immediately start gathering data, **without confirmation from users in any case.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Do I have to move my existing website/storefront to use Dollie?**
Absolutely not, Dollie can be installed on-premise, in any infrastructure/WebHost that supports WordPress, right alongside your existing WordPress storefront.

**What access to the features of Dollie do your customers see?**
You can control which Site Management features are available to your customers/clients. By using the Access Control options in Dollie you enable and disable specific features (for example giving clients the ability to create backups of their site, but disabling the advanced Developer Features)

**How can I (or my client/customers) connect a domain to my website**
Dollie comes with a “Domain Setup Wizard” that makes it easy for even novice users to connect their domain to any of the sites they manage. Through several steps, they are guided through the entire process with several checks along the way to make sure they don’t make any mistakes

**What domain do these sites deploy under?**
Dollie has a default domain to let you get started selling quickly. This means sites will be deployed under a subdomain of dollie.io e.g. client1.example.dollie.io

Dollie also lets you add your own deployment domain so that you can completely offer your services through your own brand and domain

**Are you able to access the deployed containers through SSH**
Yes, you can connect to every deployed container via SSH (for WP CLI etc) or SFTP (file management) to manage your containers.

**From the customer end, do the customers get to access billing information and invoices overview?**
Absolutely! All subscriptions and billing are done through your own Dollie installation, using the WooCommerce (Subscriptions) integration. It’s all under your domain, which you can extend and customize as you see fit.

**How frequent are your backups?**
Our backups run every 24hr and are kept for 28 days

**What happens with Support?**
Our team is here to provide you with technical infrastructure support only, for example, if a container has issues unrelated to the WordPress installation of your customer. This support is delivered through Slack and through our ticketing support channels. We do not provide direct support to your customers, but to you and your support team only.
